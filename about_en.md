  <p>When I was 10, I started reading some Cobol language. That allowed me to
  study and understand very basic statements of programming.  Even when I had
  to study a lot later, that particular experience showed me the importance of
  sharing code.</p>

  <p>These day, I really think, that sharing your code is the best way to learn
  and improve in programing. I actively participate in local meetings of free
  software, given talks, sharing my experiences and learning from the
  community.</p>

  <p>I work at my job with passion for what I do, with high values and ethical
  principles. I love being part of a group that takes very serious continuous
  improvements, research and innovation. I've been working in software
  development since 2003 and I found Ruby in 2009.  Since then I try to use it
  every chance I have.</p>
